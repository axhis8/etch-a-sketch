## About this Project

This is my second JavaScript project using the DOM, and it was quite a challenge. It was really fun to build it on my own, without much instruction this time.

This project is a task from The Odin Project, a structured full stack development course. You can learn at your own pace and it starts from 0 to getting employed. I highly recommend taking this course. More on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
